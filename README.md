# The Blocker Fraud Company



Blocker Fraud Company is a company specialized in the detection of fraud in financial transactions made through mobile devices. The company has a service called “Blocker Fraud” which guarantees the blocking of fraudulent transactions.

And the company's business model is of the Service type, with monetization made by the performance of the service provided, that is, the user pays a fixed fee on the success in detecting fraud in the client's transactions.

However, Blocker Fraud Company is expanding in Brazil and in order to acquire customers more quickly, it has adopted a very aggressive strategy. The strategy works as follows:

- The company will receive 25% of the value of each transaction that is truly detected as fraud.
- The company will receive 5% of the value of each transaction detected as fraud, however the transaction is truly legitimate.
- The company will return 100% of the value to the customer for each transaction detected as legitimate, however the transaction is truly a fraud.
With this aggressive strategy, the company assumes the risks of failing to detect fraud and is compensated for assertively detecting fraud.

For the client, it is an excellent deal to hire Blocker Fraud Company. Although the fee charged is very high on success, 25%, the company reduces its costs with correctly detected fraudulent transactions and even the damage caused by an error in the anti-fraud service will be covered by the Blocker Fraud Company itself.

For the company, in addition to getting many customers with this risky strategy of guaranteeing reimbursement in the event of a failure to detect customer fraud, it only depends on the precision and accuracy of the models built by its Data Scientists, that is, how much the more accurate the “Blocker Fraud” model, the higher the company's revenue. However, if the model has low precision, the company could have a huge loss.

### The Challenge 
You have been hired as a Data Science Consultant to create a highly accurate and highly accurate model for detecting fraud in transactions made through mobile devices.

At the end of your consultancy, you need to provide the CEO of Blocker Fraud Company with a model in production that will be accessed via API, meaning clients will send their transactions via API for your model to classify them as fraudulent or legitimate.

In addition, you will need to submit a report reporting your model's performance and results in relation to the profit and loss the company will make using the model you produced. Your report should contain the answers to the following questions:

1. What is the Precision and Accuracy of the model?
2. How Reliable is the model in classifying transactions as legitimate or fraudulent?
3. What is the Company's Expected Revenue if we classify 100% of transactions with the model?
4. What is the expected loss by the company in case of model failure?
5. What is the expected profit for the Blocker Fraud Company when using the model?
